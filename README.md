# CJTransitionsLab

Playing around with custom transitions in iOS 8, primarily trying to mimic the 'Compose Mail' transition in Mail.app. 

Based on Apple's sample code 'LookInside' (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/LookInside/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014643).
